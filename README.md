# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## **Overview**

This is a anime website built using **React, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Redux Saga,** and **Ant Design**. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to explore and discover information about movies.

This is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript, aiming to provide a platform for anime enthusiasts to explore and discover their favorite shows. The project leverages **Redux** for state management, **Redux-Saga** for handling asynchronous actions, **SCSS** for styling, **Jest** for testing, and the **Ant Design** library for a sleek and responsive design.

The design of the application is crafted using the **Ant Design** library, providing a clean and modern user interface. Ant Design components are utilized to create a consistent and visually appealing experience.

Styling is achieved using **SCSS** to enhance maintainability and provide a more structured approach to CSS. The styles are modularized and organized in the respective component folders.

The application uses **Redux** for state management. The state logic is divided into actions, reducers, and sagas to handle asynchronous operations. The Redux store is configured in **`redux/store.ts`**.
